MammothJump may be compiled with javac *.java within the command line of the folder. To run, simply type java Main. The instructions are explained on the start screen, but one may press "M" and "G" to move between game states which are the menu and the game itself. The "a" and "d" keys move the mammoth left and right in the game.
