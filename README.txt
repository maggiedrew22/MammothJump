After clicking on our zip, navigate into the folder with cd "BairdDrewIG". Mammoth Jump may be compiled with javac *.java within the command line of the folder. To run, simply type java Main. The instructions are explained on the start screen, but one may press "M" and "G" to move between game states which are the menu and the game itself. The "a" key moves the mammoth left and the "d" key moves it right in the game.
